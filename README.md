Build [semantic templates](https://www.martin-brennan.com/semantic-templates-with-mustache-js-and-handlebars-js/) with [Handlebars](https://learn.co/lessons/node-js-intro-to-handlebars).  Semantic Javascript templates are used as a replacement to constructing long strings of HTML within your Javascript logic.  The way we send files from the back end to the front end is different than with Express.

# Built With
* [HandleBars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) Anything between mustaches like this: {{}} will take a property of a Javascript object and render it straight into the template. (We could use {{{ }}} if we were absolutely certain that the internal part wouldn't execute any code that could be harmful for our servers or our users â€” use triple-curly-braces sparingly.)
